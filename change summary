1. created a DRF api-service app for creating, retrieveing, and updating a Transaction
2. Includes basic DRF session authentication 
3. All views are authentication protected and settleTransaction view is permission protected
4. SettleTransaction View is designed as POST instead of PUT or PATCH  to avoid users from updating anyfield other than status
5. Missed to start with custom user model which is recommended for new projects to make scehma changes later
6. used Django-Money field for Transaction amount
7. yet to dockerize  the app
